The first month of summer has been great! My food running job has been pretty fun and I've been working on my projects as well as hitting the gym. I finally managed to get Quizard deployed, I had to host the front end and backend seperately. The frontend was easy, as I could easily deploy that onto Vercel with a few clicks. The biggest challenge was getting it onto Heroku. I ended up making a new repository just for the backend and after some trials and tribulation, managed to get that up and running. Lastly I needed to update the proxy/fetches so that it accesses the heroku-hosted backend.

In addition to that, I'm redesinging this site to be much, much better. Heres a little sneak peak of what's to come.

So far I'm really liking how it's coming along, and I'm hoping to have it finished by the end of the month.

That's all for this post folks, I'll keep working on my projects and make the most out of this summer!
