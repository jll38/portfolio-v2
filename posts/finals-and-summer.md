title: "Finals Suck and Summer Doesn't"

It's that time of the semester, finals have left me with no time to work on my projects. Coupled with a recent trip to the ER I've just been trying to take it easy recently. Anyways, I'm finally getting back into the swing of things. First of all I want to continue learning Ruby on Rails, I started a small project just to learn a bit of how it works under the hood, but it's not going to be anything special.

Summertime is coming, which gives me time to make some money and work on big projects. I'm going to work down the shore this summer at home. I was hoping to get a Web Development internship this summer but that didn't end up working out. It is what it is though, I'll keep working hard to really sharpen my skills and make some killer projects. I got a few ideas floating around in my head but nothing concrete yet, and I want to make sure that I'm really focusing on quality rather than quantity. Should I focus on Home Sync Hub some more?

### Home Sync Hub

Home Sync Hub started off as an idea for a side hustle. I thought "what if I made purely AI generated content and convinced people to use my affiliate links to buy stuff". So I started work, used Sanity.IO content management system to organize blog posts and product listings. As of now, it really just needs to be populated with stuff and get some SEO optimization. I learned a lot from using Sanity, before I never really understood how content was truly managed, especially when it's at such large scales with news and other huge sites.

As for now, I'm hoping to end off this semester on a high note, make some money over the summer, and grind as much as possible. I do want to enjoy my summer though, as this is most likely the last summer I'll spend at home.
