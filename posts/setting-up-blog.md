Today I sit, still working on this website and all of it's functionality. I finally have the blog functionality working
so that everytime I place a new markdown file, it automatically displays it on the blog page and is accessible to read.
I'm also currently designing the "featured project" section of my homepage, made a few mockups in Figma I want to show off.

I also got Google Analytics setup to see the views of my website and where they are located, as well as the pages views and etc.
