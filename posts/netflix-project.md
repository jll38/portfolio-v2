title: "New Project and Frustrations"

As I enjoy my time back home, I've begun a new project to help showcase my skills to potential employers. 
For this project, I am simply remaking the Netflix Front End to varying success thus far. I've gotten the 
basic look and feel matching, but I've been having diffuculty getting some of these components and classes
to cooperate, especially when it comes to page scaling and responsiveness. You know the billboard that showcases
a featured show on the front page of Netflix when you log in? That has been the biggest challenge thus far for me,
because I wanted to actually display a video on the front page. The image preview works perfectly, but I'm using the
React-Player library, and the responsiveness has been such a pain to work on.

Other than that, I started my summer job recently, it's been going pretty well and I'm looking forward to making some cash.
The gym has been great as ever, definitely my favorite thing to do recently, besides going out now that I'm 21 :D.
I'm gonna keep grinding out some work and by the end of the summer I should have some great projects.

Here is the lastest commit/deployment as of this posting for the Netflix project so you can see for yourself what my frustrations have been.
